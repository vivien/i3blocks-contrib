You may want to take a look at the individual blocklet directories, which contain descriptions, screenshots, and installation/configuration instructions.

NOTE: configurations reference `$SCRIPT_DIR`, meaning the directory that you put the script into. +
You must change `$SCRIPT_DIR` appropriately to coincide with where you put your scripts, for more info see the link:https://github.com/vivien/i3blocks-contrib/wiki/FAQ#blocklets-refer-to-script_dir-what-does-that-mean-how-can-i-use-it[FAQ].
